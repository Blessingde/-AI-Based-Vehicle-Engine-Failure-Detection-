# AI-Based Vehicle Engine Failure Detection Using Sensor Data

**  **
## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect and predict engine failures using simulated real-time sensor data. Leveraging the Engine Failure Detection Dataset, we model a fault diagnosis system that mimics real-world automotive scenarios by analyzing parameters such as temperature, vibration, RPM, and torque.

The objective is to develop a reliable engine health monitoring tool that supports early fault detection and predictive maintenance. This not only improves vehicle safety and performance but also helps minimize unexpected breakdowns and operational downtime.

## ⚙️ How It Works
```markdown
1. Upload a CSV file containing engine sensor readings.
2. The model analyzes key features (temperature, torque, etc.).
3. Predictions are displayed, along with rolling averages and visual summaries.
```
